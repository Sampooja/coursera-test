                <p>Quient training is an enthusiastic group intended to train
                    students in colleges that are denied the privilege of Placement
                    training, A group of Enthusiasts now have a vision of training
                    students that don’t have access to placement training that can

                <h3>Why is Placement training important:</h3><br>
                <p><span>  </span>  Placement training plays a major role in shaping up the career goals of students. It is
                    the dream of every engineering student to get placed in a top organization visiting
                    their campus for recruitment. Keeping this key aspect into consideration, it is realized
                    that training is important for engineering students to enhance their employability skills
                    and achieve good placement in various Industries<br>
                    At present, the competition for employment is increasing every day and placement has
                    become a challenging task. Training students and equipping them with life skills has
                    become an important responsibility of the institution. Along with technical expertise,
                    the development of a holistic personality is also necessary.

                <h3><em>About Company</em></h3><br>

                <p><strong><mark> Bionic’s proprietary Growth OS solution enables Accenture Interactive clients to innovate like start-ups</mark></strong><br><br> 
 
                    NEW YORK, June 29, 2021 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) announced it has acquired Bionic to help clients ignite 
                    customer growth through an entrepreneurial approach designed for large organizations, enabling them to 
                    launch new products and businesses that fulfil unmet customer needs. The acquisition strengthens Accenture 
                    Interactive’s ability to help its clients drive growth by reimagining experiences and seizing new market 
                    and customer opportunities with less risk and more confidence.<br><br>
                     
                    Based in New York and founded in 2013, Bionic leverages its proven growth model, tools (GrowthOS™), 
                    and entrepreneurial mindsets to institutionalize growth across Fortune 1000 companies. Bionic is 
                    comprised of 40 entrepreneurs, growth investors, and designers who have helped leading businesses 
                    including P&G (Growth Works), Exelon and AB InBev’s ZX Ventures, among many others.<br><br>
                     
                    “We believe venture capital and entrepreneurship are forms of management and strategy that are 
                    incredibly relevant, but remain elusive, to big businesses as they seek growth and relevance 
                    post-pandemic,” said Baiju Shah, chief strategy officer, Accenture Interactive. “The ability 
                    to deeply understand and rapidly adapt to ever-changing customer needs is the battleground for 
                    brands today. In fact, eighty percent of CEOs acknowledge the need to reimagine their experiences 
                    to stay relevant to their customers. Bionic and Accenture Interactive will bring a new 
                    experience-led approach to customer growth, including a playbook for brands to build the 
                    organizational and operational muscles to innovate at pace.”<br><br>
                     
                    Bionic will join Accenture Interactive’s Growth and Business Design practice, which was established 
                    to meet client demand for a new approach to growth. The multidisciplined practice brings together designers, 
                    strategists, technologists, entrepreneurs, venture investors, change makers and innovators to help clients 
                    unlock new revenue streams and enable organizations to innovate at scale. Bionic’s proprietary GrowthOS™ 
                    will enhance Accenture Interactive’s existing capabilities to catapult growth for clients with a proven, 
                    customizable, scalable and repeatable solution.
